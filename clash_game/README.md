# Mini Royale

A lightweight Clash Royale style prototype built with Pygame. This demo showcases a minimal implementation with procedural sprites and basic troop and tower logic.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- pygame (see `requirements.txt`)

## Running
```
python -m clash_game.main
```

## Sprite Pipeline
Run `python -m clash_game.sprite_pipeline` to generate the placeholder sprites and sprite sheet stored in `assets/`.
These generated PNGs are ignored by git, so run the pipeline locally before launching the game.

## License
This demo is released under the MIT license. See `../LICENSE`.
